## 1. Utility Functions

-----

#### `utility_function_1(vds)`: Here's what this function does. 
  
Here's an example using it.

```python
>>> vds = mypkg.utility_function_1(vds)
```

-----

#### `utility_function_2(kt)`: Here's what this second function does.

Here's an example using the second function.

```python
>>> kt = mypkg.utility_function_2(kt)
```

## 2. Pipelines

Here are some pipelines I've been working on. Maybe this is actually Hail code,
or maybe it's a more abstract set of analysis stages.
